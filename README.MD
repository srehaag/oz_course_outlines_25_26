### Repo for extracting and categorizing AI policies in course outlines*

Due to concerns related to security (e.g. zoom links, course times and locations) outlines are not included in this repo. However, they are available on MyOsgoode via Passport York. They can be downloaded manually or using an AI agent in a browser after signing in and should be placed in subfolders in the DATA folder (F25/ and W26/)

For analysis see: ai_policies.ipynb
