      "INSTRUCTOR: Hounsell\n",
      "NUMBER: 2980\n",
      "TERM: Fall Courses\n",
      "DESCRIPTION: The legal profession is at an inflection point. As artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies transform how people live, work, and interact with institutions, the delivery of legal services is being fundamentally rethought. This course explores how the legal industry can adapt—by learning from how other sectors have navigated disruption, and by developing a new mindset for engineering the future of legal practice.\n",
      "This course invites students to consider how law can be redesigned to better serve clients, communities, and institutions in an era of rapid change. Drawing from real-world examples of innovation in business, healthcare, finance, and technology, students will explore how organizations have embraced transformation—and how similar strategies might apply to legal services. Through these parallels, we will challenge traditional assumptions about what lawyers do, how value is created, and what the future of legal work might look like.\n",
      "Students will be introduced to foundational concepts in artificial intelligence and legal technology—not for the sake of technical fluency, but to understand their strategic implications. The focus will be on how these tools reshape client expectations, redefine workflows, and open opportunities for engineering new approaches to delivering legal solutions.\n",
      "Central to the course is the application of design thinking: a user-centered, creative problem-solving methodology that will help students conceptualize new models of legal practice. Working in teams, students will identify pain points in legal service delivery and prototype innovative responses—combining legal knowledge with strategic and design-oriented thinking.\n",
      "No background in technology is required – in fact, combining creative insights from a wide variety of disciplines is the focus of the course. What’s needed is a willingness to rethink the status quo, draw insights from beyond the legal field, and adopt a mindset of legal engineering—one that blends creativity, systems thinking, and a drive to build better legal futures.\n",

      "INSTRUCTOR: Rehaag\n",
      "NUMBER: 2860\n",
      "TERM: Winter Courses\n",
      "DESCRIPTION: In this course, students will engage with law as data, using new legal technologies that promise to shift how lawyers practice in coming years, with a particular emphasis on exploring implications for access to justice. The aim is to examine not how the law regulates new legal technologies, but rather how these technologies can or should be used by legal professionals to advance the rights and interests of marginalized groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course will use a hands-on experiential pedagogy. That is, students will engage directly with new legal technologies – including by completing several small coding projects involving legal data analysis. In addition to exploring these technologies, students will critically reflect on their ethical, professional, social, and economic impacts, focusing on implications for low-income and otherwise marginalized groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "No prior coding experience is required. The course recognizes that students may bring a range of prior skills and knowledge. Both learning and evaluation have been designed to allow students who are beginners to coding and legal data analysis opportunities to successfully explore a new area, while also allowing students who already have relevant technical skills – as well as students who want to push their skillsets further – to take on more advanced projects. As such, participation is weighted heavily and final projects can be completed with limited coding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The course involves both synchronous and asynchronous components. After an initial synchronous introductory class, the first half of the course will be delivered asynchronously, through online modules and small coding projects. The instructor will be available for online troubleshooting sessions and for other support during the hours notionally set aside for classes in the weeks when modules and small coding projects are completed. Once the initial modules are completed, a synchronous discussion class will be held to explore ethical, professional, social and economic impacts, with some critical readings provided. The second half of the course will involve students working on a final project either individually or in groups (with the course instructor available for troubleshooting), presenting a draft of that project to colleagues for feedback, and finalizing the project. \n",
      "\n",
      "Synchronous sessions will be delivered in a hybrid (hyflex) format, meaning that students can elect to attend any given synchronous session either in person or remotely via Zoom. Classes will be scheduled in 3-hour blocks.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION: This seminar will explore in depth the many ways in which modern computing systems -- including the data they ingest, the decisions made by the folks who develop them, and their myriad and nearly ubiquitous applications -- may enable, encourage, or prevent societal discrimination and surveillance capitalism of various types. Students will learn how algorithms and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") systems work, how such algorithms and systems may provide differential treatment and/or outcomes for different populations, and how they may invade privacy and cause other harms to people. Students will also consider the potential legal/regulatory, technical, and social/policy interventions that could ameliorate the harms caused by such algorithms and systems and will weigh the advantages and disadvantaged of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the seminar, students should be able to (i) discuss with colleagues and others the positive and negative consequences of various current AI innovations, and (ii) suggest different approaches to address systemic bias and surveillance capitalism -- including legal/regulatory or social/policy changes, as well as technical solutions -- and explain why certain of these approaches might or might not work in specific circumstances.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION: The development of digital and network technologies has posed both opportunities and challenges for creators, publishers, and users of intellectual works. For the most part, copyright law has evolved to address these challenges by extending to embrace new media. But how well do traditional copyright principles and doctrine, developed in the heyday of the printing press, apply in the digital era when works can be created, shared, and transformed more easily than ever before? What considerations should be brought to bear by policymakers as they respond to urgent calls for copyright to \"catch up.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The objective of this seminar is to examine some of the key copyright policy questions currently before Canada’s Federal Government Departments of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) and Canadian Heritage. The seminar exposes students to the complicated process of crafting public policy and proposing law reform, and is uniquely designed to build on (and perhaps even feed into) ongoing public consultations on amendments to Canada's Copyright Act. Students will tackle issues such as Technological Neutrality and the Copyright Balance; Authorship and Artificial Intelligence; Reproduction for Informational Analysis (Text & Data Mining); Digital Locks and the Right of Repair; Intermediary Liability and Website-blocking; the Regulation of Digital News Intermediaries; Non-Fungible-Tokens and Digital Art; User-Generated Content and Fair Dealing; Controlled Digital Lending and e-Books; Crown Copyright; and Copyright Term Extension. We will critically examine recent policy reports, bills, statutory amendments, treaties, and case law, as well as emerging industry and consumer practices, stakeholder demands, and the political dynamics of the copyright lawmaking scene. Copyright policy implicates, in addition to the letter and spirit of Canada’s Copyright Act, issues of constitutional law and fundamental rights, international and comparative law, and socio-legal theory.\n",
